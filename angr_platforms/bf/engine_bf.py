        As input, we get the current state, which contains the value of the two registers (ip and ptr),
        and the program's code and data memory.
        We then perform a series of symbolic actions on this state, until the block ends, at which point we define
        its "successors" -- where execution can possibly go from here.
        The basic block ends when:
            1) A branch is reached.  The successors are the next instruction if the branch is taken,
            and the instruction if it is not.
            2) Input and Output.  We're modeling I/O as a system call, so this ends the block.
            3) ip points somewhere outside the program's memory.  In Brainfuck, this is the simple halting case.
